A major proportion of our students face challenges while making career decisions throughout the career span. Many end up pursuing the wrong career direction which leads to a lack of satisfaction, frustration, unemployment, and eventually major turns in career direction. However, we have proposed a solution where we will analyze the psychometric interest and subconscious influence on career selection. The students will fill out the questionaries, in which each question set will evaluate the different personality perspectives and explore the innate nature of the student’s mind. In the next step, we will use the questionnaire results to find the natural abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Then these results will be used to predict the personality-compatible profession.
